## 3. Review Criteria

Each work product is assessed against the following dimensions:

| Criterion | Description | Check Method |
|---|---|---|
| **C1 — Completeness** | All required sections present; no placeholder text (`<fill …>`, TBD, N/A without explanation) | Read each section |
| **C2 — Consistency** | Version numbers, rule counts, module names, test counts, and CI targets agree across documents | Cross-check PA2, SWE4, README |
| **C3 — Traceability** | Requirements trace to design; design traces to tests; tests trace to CI evidence | Check traceability matrices |
| **C4 — Correctness** | Technical content matches the actual codebase (file paths, module names, rule IDs, test names) | Compare against `src/` and `tests/` |
| **C5 — Clarity** | Text is unambiguous; definitions are consistent; no contradictions within the document | Read for understanding |

---

## 4. Per-Document Checklist

## 7. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

> **Note (CSC-DEV-002):** CStyleCheck is developed by a solo engineer. The independent peer-review requirement of ASPICE GP 2.2.3 cannot be satisfied by a separate human reviewer in the conventional sense. This review is conducted by the AI tool (Claude) acting in the reviewer role, as formally documented in CSC-DEV-002. The Review Owner's merge of the pull request that adds this record constitutes the required management approval; no signature is required, and the merge commit is the approval record (approval-by-merge policy of 2026-09-29, CSC-DEV-002 §5.2). Set §1 Status to "Approved — Review Owner authorisation by merge (CSC-DEV-002 §5.2)".
