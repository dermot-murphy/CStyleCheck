## 3. Purpose & Scope

This Change Request Management Plan defines the process for requesting, evaluating, approving, implementing, and verifying changes to any controlled configuration item of **CNameCheck v1.0.0**. It satisfies **Automotive SPICE® PAM v4.0, SUP.10 — Change Request Management**.

A **change request (CR)** covers any planned modification to a baselined work product that is not a defect fix — including new features, new rules, configuration changes, documentation updates, and process improvements. Defect fixes are handled under SUP.9 but also follow this plan for their change-control steps once the fix has been accepted.

### 3.1 Referenced Documents

| Document ID | Title | Version |
|---|---|---|
| CNC-SUP8-001 | Configuration Management Plan | 1.1 |
| CNC-SUP9-001 | Problem Resolution Management Plan | 1.0 |
| CNC-MAN3-001 | Project Management Plan | 1.0 |

## 4. Change Request Classification

### 4.1 Change Types

| Type | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Enhancement** | `enhancement` | New rule, new output format, new CLI flag, new integration |
| **Improvement** | `improvement` | Optimisation, UX improvement, performance improvement |
| **Documentation** | `documentation` | Update to ASPICE documents, README, or in-code documentation |
| **Configuration** | `config-change` | Update to `naming_convention.yaml`, `exclusions.yml`, or dictionary files |
| **Process** | `process-change` | Update to CI workflows, Git Flow procedure, or QA activities |

### 4.2 Impact Levels

| Impact | Criteria | Approval Required |
|---|---|---|
| **Low** | Changes a single CI; no interface impact; no requirement change | Author self-review |
| **Medium** | Changes multiple CIs; impacts one interface; minor requirement change | Peer review (1 approver) |
| **High** | Changes architecture, adds/removes requirements, breaks backwards compatibility | Peer review + explicit QA sign-off |

---

## 5. Change Request Process

### 5.1 Raising a Change Request

All change requests are raised as **GitHub Issues** with the `enhancement`, `improvement`, `documentation`, `config-change`, or `process-change` label.

Minimum required fields when raising a CR Issue:

| Field | Required Content |
|---|---|
| **Title** | `[CR] <brief description of change>` |
| **Type label** | One of the type labels from §4.1 |
| **Impact level** | Low / Medium / High |
| **Motivation** | Why the change is needed; which stakeholder need or deficiency it addresses |
| **Description** | What specifically will change; which CIs (from CNC-SUP8-001 §6.1) are affected |
| **Affected documents** | Which ASPICE work products require updating |
| **Proposed target release** | Which version the change is planned for |

### 5.2 Change Evaluation

1. Issue assigned to Dermot Murphy for evaluation
2. Assess: technical feasibility, effort estimate, impact on existing requirements, impact on test suite, version number implications (patch/minor/major)
3. Check for conflicts with open Issues or other planned changes
4. Evaluate impact on ASPICE documents — identify which WPs need revision
5. Record evaluation outcome in the Issue comment thread

### 5.3 Change Approval

| Impact Level | Approval Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Low | Author marks Issue as approved in comment; proceeds to implementation |
| Medium | At least one peer review approval on the implementing pull request |
| High | Explicit approval comment from QA role in the Issue thread before implementation begins |

Changes that modify requirements (CNC-SWE1-001 or CNC-SYS2-001) always require Medium or High approval regardless of other impact assessment.

### 5.4 Implementation

Accepted changes are implemented following the Git Flow process defined in CNC-SUP8-001 §7:

| Change Type | Branch | Target |
|---|---|---|
| New feature or enhancement | `feature/<issue-id>-<description>` | `develop` |
| Configuration or documentation | `feature/<issue-id>-<description>` | `develop` |
| Urgent backwards-compatible fix affecting released version | `hotfix/<issue-id>-<description>` | `main` and `develop` |

Commit messages must reference the Issue: `Implements #<issue-id>: <description>`

All implementing PRs must:
- Pass CI (`cnamecheck_tests.yml`, `naming_convention.yml`)
- Include or update affected ASPICE documents in the same branch or a linked follow-up Issue
- Update traceability tables if requirements are added or modified

### 5.5 Verification

1. CI must pass on the implementing branch
2. If the CR adds a new rule: at least one test case must be added to the test suite demonstrating the rule fires on invalid input and passes on valid input
3. If the CR changes a requirement: the corresponding SWE.4/SWE.6 test case must be updated
4. Pull request reviewer confirms all affected documents have been updated before approving

### 5.6 Closure

- Issue is closed when the implementing PR is merged
- If the CR affects a released version: version number is incremented per semantic versioning
  - Patch (`1.0.x`): backwards-compatible bug fixes
  - Minor (`1.x.0`): new rules, new CLI flags, new output formats (backwards compatible)
  - Major (`x.0.0`): breaking changes (removed flags, changed default behaviour, incompatible config format)
- Release notes for the target release must reference the CR Issue number

## 6. Impact on Configuration Items

When a CR is approved, the following CIs may require update:

| CR Type | Likely Affected CIs |
|---|---|
| New rule | CI-001 (`cnamecheck.py`), CI-003 (`naming_convention.yaml`), CI-017 (test suite), CI-026 (README) |
| New CLI flag | CI-001, CI-013 (`pyproject.toml`), CI-016 (`action.yml`), CI-026 (README) |
| New output format | CI-001, CI-016 (`action.yml`), CI-026 (README) |
| Config file change | CI-003 or CI-005 to CI-010 |
| CI workflow change | CI-023 to CI-025 |
| ASPICE document update | Affected document CI (e.g., CI-027) + new version entry in §2 |

All affected CIs must be updated within the same Git Flow branch as the implementing change (or in an explicitly linked follow-up Issue tracked to the same release).

## 7. Change Request Register

The GitHub Issues board at `https://github.com/dermot-murphy/CNameCheck/issues` serves as the CR register. Filter by enhancement/improvement/documentation/config-change/process-change labels.

Summary view:

| Issue # | Type | Title | Impact | Status | Target Release |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| \<Auto-populated from GitHub Issues — see Issues board\> | | | | | |

---

## 8. Metrics

| Metric | Measurement | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Open CRs | GitHub Issues count by CR-type labels | Weekly |
| CRs accepted per release | Count of closed CR Issues per release tag | Per release |
| Mean CR cycle time | Days from Issue open to PR merge | Per release |
| CRs that required document updates | Count of CRs with ASPICE document changes | Per release |

---

## 9. Review & Approval

| Role | Name | Signature / Electronic Approval | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author | Dermot Murphy | | 2026-04-12 |
| Technical Reviewer | \<Name\> | | |
| Quality Assurance | \<Name\> | | |
| Approver | \<Name\> | | |

> **⚠️ Important:** All High-impact CRs require explicit QA approval before implementation. No CR affecting released baseline CIs may be implemented without following this process. This plan must be placed under configuration management (SUP.8) upon approval.
