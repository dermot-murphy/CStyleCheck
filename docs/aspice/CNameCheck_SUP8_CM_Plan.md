This plan satisfies the requirements of **Automotive SPICE® PAM v4.0, SUP.8 — Configuration Management**.

### 3.2 Scope

This plan applies to all configuration items produced by the CStyleCheck project, including:

- Source code and supporting scripts
- Test suite and test data
- Configuration and rule definition files
- CI/CD workflow definitions
- Packaging and container artefacts
- Project documentation (including this plan)

### 6.2 Identification Scheme

- **Source files** are identified by file path within the repository and Git commit SHA
- **Releases** are identified by semantic version tag in the format `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
- **Docker images** are tagged using the scheme:
  - On version tag `v1.2.3`: `:1.2.3`, `:1.2`, `:1`, `:latest`
  - On branch push: `:main`, `:sha-<short>`
- **CI artefacts** (coverage reports) are identified by workflow run ID and Python version matrix entry
- **Documents** use the ID scheme `CNC-<PROCESS>-<NNN>` (e.g., `CNC-SUP8-001`)

---

## 7. Branching Strategy

CStyleCheck uses the **Git Flow** branching model. The following branches are defined and maintained under configuration control.

### 7.1 Permanent Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Protection Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Production-ready code only; reflects the latest release baseline | Direct push prohibited; merged from `release/*` or `hotfix/*` only; every merge creates a version tag |
| `develop` | Integration branch for completed features; always buildable | Direct push restricted; merged from `feature/*` and `bugfix/*` via pull request; CI must pass |

### 7.2 Supporting Branches

| Branch Pattern | Created From | Merges Into | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `feature/<issue-id>-<short-description>` | `develop` | `develop` | New feature or enhancement; one branch per GitHub Issue |
| `bugfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>` | `develop` | `develop` | Non-critical bug fix targeting the next release |
| `release/<version>` | `develop` | `main` and `develop` | Release preparation; version bump, final testing, and docs only — no new features |
| `hotfix/<issue-id>-<short-description>` | `main` | `main` and `develop` | Critical production defect requiring immediate patch release |

### 7.3 Branch Naming Convention

Supporting branches shall be named using the following scheme:

- `feature/42-add-misra-rule-15` — feature branch for GitHub Issue #42
- `bugfix/67-fix-typedef-false-positive` — bug fix for GitHub Issue #67
- `release/1.1.0` — release preparation for version 1.1.0
- `hotfix/89-null-pointer-crash` — hotfix for critical Issue #89

### 7.4 Git Flow Lifecycle

```
develop ──────────────────────────────────────────────────►
         ↑   ↑                   ↑
         │   └── feature/* ──────┘
         │
release/* branch ──► main ──► tag v1.0.0
                  └──────────► develop (back-merge)

main ──► hotfix/* ──► main ──► tag v1.0.1
                   └────────► develop (back-merge)
```

### 7.5 CI Enforcement

- All merges to `develop` and `main` require CI (`cnamecheck_tests.yml`) to pass
- The `naming_convention.yml` workflow runs the linter against the project's own source on every commit touching C files, enforcing self-hosting of the tool's own rules
- Supporting branches are deleted after merge

> **📋 Note:** The `release/*` branch is the only branch where version-bump commits (`_version.py`, `pyproject.toml`) and release notes updates are permitted outside of `develop`. No new features may be introduced on a `release/*` branch.

---

## 8. Baseline Management

### 8.1 Baseline Types

| Baseline Type | Trigger | Git Mechanism | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Development Baseline** | Successful CI run on `main` | Commit SHA on `main` | Latest passing source + tests |
| **Release Baseline** | Manual decision to release | Annotated Git tag `v*.*.*` | Full repository snapshot at that commit |
| **Container Baseline** | Docker publish workflow | GHCR image digest + tag | Immutable Docker image layer set |

### 8.2 Release Baseline Procedure

1. A `release/<version>` branch is created from `develop`; all CI checks pass (unit tests across Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12, naming convention check, Docker build)
2. `_version.py` reflects the intended release version (generated via `git describe --tags`)
3. The `release/<version>` branch is merged into `main` and back-merged into `develop`
4. An annotated tag is created on `main`: `git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"`
5. Tag is pushed: `git push origin v1.0.0`
6. `docker_publish.yml` automatically builds and pushes the tagged image to GHCR and Docker Hub
7. A GitHub Release entry is created with release notes derived from the change log
8. The `release/<version>` branch is deleted

### 8.3 Baseline Integrity

- Git SHA is the primary integrity mechanism for source baselines
- Docker image digest (SHA-256) provides integrity verification for container baselines
- The `build-and-push` job prints the image digest to the Actions log as an audit record
- Layer caching uses a dedicated `:buildcache` tag in GHCR to speed incremental builds without affecting release tags

---

## 9. Change Control

Changes to controlled configuration items shall follow the change control process defined in **CNC-SUP10-001 (Change Request Management Plan)**. In summary:

1. A change request (CR) or problem resolution record is raised as a **GitHub Issue**, labelled appropriately (`bug`, `enhancement`, `change-request`)
2. The Issue is linked in all related branch names and commit messages (e.g., `Closes #42`)
3. The change is implemented on the appropriate Git Flow branch (`feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, or `hotfix/*`) per §7
4. A pull request is opened targeting `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes); CI must pass and at least one review approval is required before merge
5. The merged commit SHA is recorded in the GitHub Issue closure comment
6. If the change affects a release, a `release/*` branch is created and a new version tag applied per §8.2

> **⚠️ Important:** Changes to `src/naming_convention.yaml` (CI-003) or dictionary files (CI-008 to CI-010) require explicit review as they directly affect linter behaviour and may introduce breaking changes for downstream users.

## 10. Configuration Status Accounting

### 10.1 Status Tracking

| Mechanism | What It Tracks |
|---|---|
| GitHub commit history | Full chronological record of all changes to every CI |
| GitHub Issues | Problem resolution records and change requests, linked to commits and pull requests |
| GitHub Pull Requests | Review record, CI pass/fail, approvals, merge commit, and linked Issue closure |
| GitHub Actions run log | CI execution evidence per commit; coverage artefact per run |
| GitHub Releases | Named release baselines with artefact links |
| GHCR image tags | Container release history with immutable digests |

### 10.2 Reporting

Configuration status shall be accessible at any time via:

- `git log --oneline` — commit history
- `git tag -l` — all release baselines
- GitHub Releases page — named releases with notes
- GHCR package page — container image history and digests

---

## 11. Configuration Audits

### 11.1 Functional Configuration Audit (FCA)

Performed prior to each release baseline to verify:

- [ ] All CI-001 to CI-027 items are present and committed
- [ ] Version in `_version.py` (CI-002) matches the intended tag
- [ ] All unit tests pass on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- [ ] Naming convention workflow passes on current source
- [ ] Docker image builds without error
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` version (CI-013) matches `_version.py`
- [ ] `README.md` is up to date with the release

### 11.2 Physical Configuration Audit (PCA)

Performed after tagging to verify:

- [ ] Git tag points to the correct commit
- [ ] Docker image digest is recorded in the GitHub Actions run log
- [ ] GitHub Release entry references the correct tag and digest
- [ ] No uncommitted changes exist on `main` at the point of tagging

### 11.3 Audit Schedule

| Audit Type | Frequency |
|---|---|
| Functional Configuration Audit | Before every release |
| Physical Configuration Audit | After every release tag |
| Informal CM Review | Monthly, or on any SUP.10 change request affecting CIs |

---

## 12. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **CM Manager** (Claude) | Owns this plan; approves baselines; creates release tags; manages GHCR |
| **Developer** | Creates Git Flow branches; raises GitHub Issues; opens pull requests; links commits and PRs to Issues |
| **Reviewer** | Reviews PRs; confirms CI pass before approving; approves merge |
| **CI System** (GitHub Actions) | Automated enforcement: runs tests, linting, Docker build on every push/PR |

---

## 13. Backup & Recovery

| Item | Mechanism | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| Source repository | GitHub hosted (distributed Git — every clone is a backup) | Re-clone from GitHub or any developer's local copy |
| Docker images | GHCR + Docker Hub (dual registry) | Pull from either registry by tag or digest |
| CI artefacts | GitHub Actions artefacts (30-day retention) | Re-run the workflow from the same commit SHA to regenerate |

> **📋 Note:** Because Git is a distributed VCS, every developer's local clone constitutes an independent backup of all commits and tags up to their last `fetch`. The primary risk is loss of GitHub-hosted Issues and pull request history; this is mitigated by GitHub's platform reliability and the requirement to reference Issue numbers in all commit messages and branch names.

---

## 14. Review & Approval

| Role | Name | Signature / Electronic Approval | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author | Claude | | 2026-04-11 |
| Technical Reviewer | \<Name\> | | |
| Quality Assurance | \<Name\> | | |
| Approver | \<Name\> | | |

> **⚠️ Important:** This document must be approved before the first release baseline is established. Post-approval changes must follow the change request process (SUP.10) and a new version issued.
