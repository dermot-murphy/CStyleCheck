## 3. Purpose & Scope

### 3.1 Purpose

This System Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the complete, structured set of system-level requirements for **CStyleCheck v1.6.0 and the post-v1.6.0 `develop` baseline** — an embedded C naming-convention linter implementing Barr-C:2018 and MISRA-C complementary rules across 81 rule IDs (73 at v1.6.0).

This document satisfies the requirements of **Automotive SPICE® PAM v4.0, SYS.2 — System Requirements Analysis**.

### 3.2 Scope

CStyleCheck is a software-only system. It operates as a static analysis tool that accepts C source files and a rule-configuration file as inputs, evaluates each identifier in those files against the configured naming rules, and produces a structured violation report as output.

The system is deployed in four integration modes:

1. **Command-line tool** — invoked directly via Python or as a pip-installed entry point
2. **GitHub Action** — integrated into GitHub Actions CI workflows via `action.yml`
3. **pre-commit hook** — integrated into pre-commit framework via `.pre-commit-hooks.yml`
4. **Docker container** — packaged as a portable, self-contained image for CI/CD pipelines

### 3.3 Referenced Documents

| CSC-SWE1-001 | CStyleCheck Software Requirements Analysis | 2.19 |

### 3.4 Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| CI | Configuration Item or Continuous Integration (context-dependent) |
| Identifier | Any named entity in C source: variable, function, type, macro, enum, struct tag |
| Rule ID | A dot-separated string identifying a specific naming rule (e.g., `variable.global.case`) |
| Severity | Classification of a violation: `error`, `warning`, or `info` |
| Module prefix | The filename stem of the source file used as a mandatory identifier prefix |
| Baseline | A saved JSON file of known violations used to suppress pre-existing findings |
| SARIF | Static Analysis Results Interchange Format (v2.1.0) |

> **Bidirectional-trace note (AUD9-F-008):** Each SWE1 requirement listed above cites the SYS requirement in this row as its parent (CSC-SWE1-001 v2.10 parent column). SWE1-102 to SWE1-108 and SWE1-117 (trend-analysis CI scripts) have no SYS parent; they derive from CSC-MAN3-001 §10.3 process monitoring. SYS-NF-003 to SYS-NF-006 are verified at system level (CI matrix, Docker build), and SYS-NF-010 to SYS-NF-012 are deferred or out of scope.
