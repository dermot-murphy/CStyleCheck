## 4. Project Scope and Objectives

### 4.1 In Scope

- Design, implementation, and testing of `src/cstylecheck/` package (10 sub-modules) implementing 53 rule IDs
- Test suite (1281 pytest tests across 53 test modules)
- Docker image build and multi-platform publication to GHCR and Docker Hub
- GitHub Action integration (`action.yml`)
- pre-commit hook integration (`.pre-commit-hooks.yml`)
- pip/pipx packaging (`pyproject.toml`)
- Full ASPICE CL2 documentation set (SYS.2–SYS.5, SWE.1–SWE.6, MAN.3, MAN.5, SUP.1, SUP.8–SUP.10, ACQ.4, PA 2.1, PA 2.2)
- CI/CD automation via GitHub Actions (3 workflows)

### 4.2 Out of Scope

- GUI or IDE plugin
- C++ language support beyond C/C++ keyword detection
- Hardware engineering or mechanical engineering processes
- Machine learning engineering processes

### 4.3 Feasibility Assessment

| Constraint | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Technical** | Python-only implementation; single-file architecture; no exotic dependencies. Technically feasible with one engineer |
| **Schedule** | v1.0.0 development complete; documentation phase in progress |
| **Resources** | Solo developer; GitHub Actions for CI/CD (zero compute cost for public repo) |
| **Standards compliance** | ASPICE CL2 documentation producible; naming convention self-check demonstrable |

## 5. Project Lifecycle

CStyleCheck follows a **Git Flow** based lifecycle aligned with the V-model:

```
Requirements  →  Architecture  →  Detailed Design  →  Implementation
    (SYS.2/SWE.1)   (SYS.3/SWE.2)     (SWE.3)            (SWE.3 BP8)
         ↑                                                       ↓
  System Verification  ←  SW Qualification  ←  SW Integration  ←  Unit Verification
      (SYS.5)               (SWE.6)              (SWE.5)           (SWE.4)
```

## 9. Project Interfaces

| Interface | Counterpart | Type | Communication Method | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INT-01 | End users (embedded C developers) | External | GitHub README, GitHub Releases, Docker Hub | On release |
| INT-02 | CI/CD system (GitHub Actions) | Internal tool | `push` / `pull_request` event triggers | Per commit/PR |

---

## 10. Progress Monitoring and Reporting

### 10.1 Monitoring Approach

| Activity | Method | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Build and test status | GitHub Actions CI badge on README | Continuous (per commit) |
| Test pass rate | `cstylecheck_tests.yml` — pytest result matrix | Per commit to `develop`/`main` |
| Naming convention compliance | `rules.yml` CI job | Per commit touching `src/` |
| Code coverage | `pytest-cov` — `coverage.xml` artefact | Per CI run on Python 3.11 |
| Open Issues (bugs/changes) | GitHub Issues board | Reviewed weekly |
| WBS progress | Manual update to this document | Per milestone |
| Risk status | Risk register (CSC-MAN5-001) | Monthly or on new risk identified |

### 10.2 Corrective Action Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| CI test failure on `develop` or `main` | Raise GitHub Issue; fix on `bugfix/` branch before next merge |
| Coverage drop below target threshold | Raise Issue; add missing tests before next release |
| Naming convention CI failure on own source | Raise Issue; fix in same commit; never merge failing source |
| Milestone slipped by >1 week | Update schedule; assess risk impact; update CSC-MAN5-001 |
| New risk identified | Add to risk register (CSC-MAN5-001); assign treatment |
