## 4. Findings

| Finding ID | Document | Criterion | Severity | Description | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RR-002-001 | CSC-SYS4-001 | C1 | Minor | No system integration test cases exist for the 11 rules added in v1.3.0/v1.4.0 (issues #221–#232). Existing 14 SITC cases cover the original rule set only. | Open — tracked issues #221–#232, targeted v1.5.0 |
| RR-002-002 | CSC-SYS5-001 | C1 | Minor | No SYS-VTC verification test entries exist for the 11 rules added in v1.3.0/v1.4.0. Document fix (53→71 rule ID count) applied in PR #280; test case gap remains. | Open — tracked issues #221–#232, targeted v1.5.0 |
| RR-002-003 | CSC-SWE5-001 | C1 | Minor | No software integration test cases exist for the 11 rules added in v1.3.0/v1.4.0. Existing 18 SIT cases cover the original rule set only. | Open — tracked issues #221–#232, targeted v1.5.0 |
| RR-002-004 | CSC-SWE6-001 | C1 | Minor | No software qualification test cases exist for the 11 rules added in v1.3.0/v1.4.0. SWQ-003 rule count updated to 71 (PR #280); test case gap remains. | Open — tracked issues #221–#232, targeted v1.5.0 |

> All four findings share the same root cause: the integration, system, and qualification test documents were not extended when 11 new rules were added across the v1.3.0 and v1.4.0 releases. This is a known, tracked gap. It does not prevent CL2 from being awarded but does hold SYS.4, SYS.5, SWE.5, and SWE.6 at L rather than F.

## 5. Review Summary

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **Total work products reviewed** | 21 |
| **Work products with no findings** | 17 |
| **Work products with findings** | 4 |
| **Total findings** | 4 |
| **— Major** | 0 |
| **— Minor** | 4 |
| **— Observation** | 0 |
| **Open actions** | 4 (all tracked via GitHub issues #221–#232) |
| **Review verdict** | **Conditional Pass** |

**Verdict rationale:**

All 21 ASPICE work products are substantially complete, mutually consistent, and correctly describe the v1.4.1 codebase. Rule counts have been corrected from 53 to 71 across all affected documents (PRs #280–#282). Risk treatments RISK-003 and RISK-005 are now fully implemented (`.github/dependabot.yml`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`). The AI supplier entry (SUP-06) has been added to the ACQ.4 register. No Major findings were identified. The four Minor findings all share the same root cause — missing test coverage for 11 new rules added in v1.3.0/v1.4.0 — and are fully tracked in GitHub issues #221–#232 with a v1.5.0 target. The review is approved as Conditional Pass pending resolution of these findings.

## 6. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reviewer | Claude (AI-assisted) | 2026-06-26 | *Per CSC-DEV-001 (AI authorship deviation)* |
| Author / Review Owner | Dermot Murphy | Merge date of the introducing PR | *Authorised by the owner's merge of the PR that added this record (CSC-DEV-002 §5.2); no signature required* |

> **Note (CSC-DEV-002):** CStyleCheck is developed by a solo engineer. The independent peer-review requirement of ASPICE GP 2.2.3 cannot be satisfied by a separate human reviewer in the conventional sense. This review was conducted by the AI tool (Claude) acting in the reviewer role, as formally documented in CSC-DEV-002. The Review Owner's merge of the PR that added this record constitutes the required management approval; the merge commit is the approval record (approval-by-merge policy of 2026-09-29, CSC-DEV-002 §5.2).
