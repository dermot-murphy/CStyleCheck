## 3. Deviation Summary

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Deviation ID** | CSC-DEV-001 |
| **Problem Record** | CSC-SUP9 Issue #52 |
| **Severity** | SEV-2 Major |
| **Standard Clause** | ASPICE PAM v4.0, GP 2.1.6 — Define Responsibilities |
| **Affected Documents** | All 18 ASPICE work products in `docs/aspice/` |
| **Disposition** | **Accepted with justification** |

---

## 4. Non-Conformance Description

### 4.1 What the Standard Requires

ASPICE PAM v4.0, Generic Practice **GP 2.1.6 — Define Responsibilities** requires that:

> *"Responsibilities and authorities for performing the defined activities of the process are assigned to individuals and/or groups."*

ASPICE assessment practice interprets this as requiring **named, accountable human persons** for all defined roles. An assessor expects to find human names against Author, Reviewer, and role-holder fields in all work products so that accountability can be traced.

### 4.2 Actual State

All 18 ASPICE work products in `docs/aspice/` carry:

- `Author: Claude` in the Document Identification header
- `Claude` in Revision History Author column (initial release entries)
- `Claude` as role-holder in CSC-PA2-001 GP 2.1.6 role table (Project Manager / CM Manager, Lead Developer, Test Lead)
- `Claude` as responsible party in activity/monitoring tables (CSC-ACQ4-001, CSC-MAN3-001, CSC-MAN5-001)
- `Claude` in approval signature blocks

Claude is an AI assistant (Anthropic Claude), not a human individual.

### 4.3 Root Cause

CStyleCheck was developed using Claude as an AI-assisted authoring tool throughout the ASPICE documentation phase. The AI-generated content was reviewed and accepted by the human responsible (Dermot Murphy), but the Author fields were not updated to reflect the human accountable party.

---

## 5. Justification for Acceptance

### 5.1 Project Context

CStyleCheck is a personal open-source project with a **single human developer and decision-maker: Dermot Murphy**. There are no other human team members. In this context:

- Claude is a **tool**, not a team member. Its role is analogous to a word processor, a code generator, or a documentation template system. The outputs it produces carry no independent authority.
- Every work product listed in §4.2 was **reviewed and approved by Dermot Murphy** before release. The `Reviewer` and `Approver` fields on all 18 documents correctly name Dermot Murphy.
- All ASPICE work products are committed to a Git repository under Dermot Murphy's GitHub account (`dermot-murphy`). The commit history constitutes an audit trail of human acceptance.
- All decisions — requirements, architecture, design, risk treatment, and process definitions — were made by Dermot Murphy. Claude provided drafts; Dermot Murphy accepted, modified, or rejected each.

### 5.2 Accountability Chain

| Role per GP 2.1.6 | Nominal Entry | Actual Accountable Person |
|---|---|---|
| Project Manager / CM Manager | Claude | Dermot Murphy |
| Lead Developer | Claude | Dermot Murphy |
| Test Lead | Claude | Dermot Murphy |
| Author (all documents) | Claude | Dermot Murphy |
| Reviewer (all documents) | Dermot Murphy | Dermot Murphy ✅ |
| Approver (all documents) | Dermot Murphy | Dermot Murphy ✅ |

The human accountability chain is intact. "Claude" entries reflect the authoring tool, not an independent actor.

### 5.3 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Assessor rejects evidence due to AI author field | Medium | High | This deviation document constitutes the formal acceptance record; assessor may be directed to it |
| Traceability gap if Claude AI is unavailable | Low | Low | All accepted content is version-controlled; no dependency on Claude for future work |
| Misunderstanding of AI role in project | Low | Medium | §5.1 and §5.2 above clarify the tool vs. person distinction |

**Residual risk: MEDIUM** — an ASPICE assessor may still raise an observation. This deviation provides the formal basis for rebuttal.

## 6. Corrective Action

No change is made to the work product Author fields. The `Author: Claude` entries are accepted as a record of the authoring tool used. This is consistent with the practice of noting document generation tools (e.g., "Generated by Doxygen") without implying the tool holds accountability.

**Actions required:**

| Action | Owner | Target Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create this deviation document (CSC-DEV-001) | Dermot Murphy | 2026-05-28 | ✅ Complete |
| Add CSC-DEV-001 to CSC-PA2-001 GP 2.1.6 section with explanatory note | Dermot Murphy | 2026-05-28 | ✅ Complete |
| Add CSC-DEV-001 to CSC-SUP8-001 Configuration Item list | Dermot Murphy | 2026-05-28 | ✅ Complete |
| Reference deviation in Analysis Report finding for issue #52 | Dermot Murphy | 2026-05-28 | ✅ Complete |

---

## 7. Approval

This deviation is accepted on the basis that Dermot Murphy is the sole accountable human for all work products, the authoring tool ("Claude") has no independent authority, and the Reviewer/Approver fields correctly identify the human responsible party throughout.

| Role | Name | Signature | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Author | Dermot Murphy | Approved | 2026-05-28 |
| Approver | Dermot Murphy | Approved | 2026-05-28 |
