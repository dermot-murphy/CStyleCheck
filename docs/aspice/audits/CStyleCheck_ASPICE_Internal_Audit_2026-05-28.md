### 2.2 Artefacts Reviewed

The following artefacts were read and cross-checked during this audit:

- All 21 ASPICE process documents in `docs/aspice/`
- `src/cstylecheck/` package — all 10 source modules
- `src/rules.yml` and `tests/rules.yml`
- All 20 test files under `tests/test_*.py`
- `tests/harness.py`
- `.github/workflows/cstylecheck_tests.yml`
- `.github/workflows/cstylecheck_rules.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docker_publish.yml`
- `.github/workflows/wiki_publish.yml`
- `pyproject.toml`
- CI run evidence from GitHub Actions

### 2.3 Methodology

For each process the following questions were applied:

**PA 2.1 — Process Performance Management:**
- Are performance objectives defined and measurable? (GP 2.1.1)
- Is there a defined process strategy? (GP 2.1.2)
- Is the process planned, monitored, and adjusted? (GP 2.1.3–5)
- Are responsibilities defined? (GP 2.1.6)
- Are interfaces managed? (GP 2.1.7)

**PA 2.2 — Work Product Management:**
- Are work product requirements defined? (GP 2.2.1)
- Are work products stored and version-controlled? (GP 2.2.2)
- Are work products reviewed before approval? (GP 2.2.3)
- Are work products adjusted based on reviews? (GP 2.2.4)

Evidence gaps were classified using the ASPICE PAM v4.0 scale:

| Rating | Meaning | Achievement Range |
|---|---|---|
| **N** | Not achieved | 0–15% |
| **P** | Partially achieved | 15–50% |
| **L** | Largely achieved | 50–85% |
| **F** | Fully achieved | 85–100% |

## 3. Findings

### 3.1 Summary Table

| Finding ID | ASPICE Finding | Severity | Processes Affected | Issue Raised |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F-001 | SWE2/SYS3 still describe monolith — component descriptions stale after package refactor | High | SWE.2, SYS.3 | #146 |
| F-003 | SWE5 integration test results all placeholders — no execution evidence | High | SWE.5 | #152 |
| F-004 | SYS4 system integration test results blank — no evidence | High | SYS.4 | #152 |
| F-005 | CI gate 85% vs SUP1 documented target 90% statement coverage | Medium | SWE.4, SUP.1 | #151 |
| F-006 | SYS-NF-010/011/012 deferred with no tracking or resolution plan | Medium | SYS.2, SYS.5 | #153 |
| F-007 | SYS5 verification record execution placeholders not filled | Medium | SYS.5 | #152 |
| F-008 | CI path trigger stale — changes to `src/cstylecheck/**` did not trigger tests | High | SUP.8 | **Fixed in PR #145** |
| F-009 | `wiki_publish.yml` not registered in SUP8 CI inventory | Low | SUP.8 | #150 |
| F-010 | SWE1/SWE4 document `yoda_condition` (singular) — config key is `yoda_conditions` (plural) | Medium | SWE.1, SWE.4 | #149 |
| F-011 | MAN3 WBS-10 through WBS-16 have no planned or actual completion dates | Medium | MAN.3 | #154 |
| F-012 | PA2 §5.4 document version table stale | Low | PA 2.1/2.2 | #156 |
| F-013 | SWE4 §5.1 count (32) disagrees with §6 entries (35) for test_variables.py | Low | SWE.4 | #157 |
| F-014 | RISK-003 and RISK-005 have no concrete mitigation actions or owners | Medium | MAN.5, ACQ.4 | #155 |

> **Note — F-002 and F-016 from the gap analysis are not recorded as findings:**
> - F-002: `comment_ratio` and `declared_not_defined` are fully documented in SWE1/SWE3/SWE4; only `whitespace_ratio` is missing (captured as F-017).
> - F-016: `pyproject.toml` correctly uses `packages = ["cstylecheck"]` with `package-dir = {"" = "src"}` — no issue.

### 3.2 Resolved Items (from prior Analysis Report)

The following critical findings from the prior Analysis Report are **confirmed resolved** at this audit date:

### 5.2 Overall CL2 Verdict

> **ASPICE CL2 is NOT YET achieved. Overall verdict: Largely Achieved.**

Fourteen of seventeen processes achieve **L** (Largely Achieved) at both PA 2.1 and PA 2.2. Three processes — SYS.4, SYS.5, and SWE.5 — achieve only **P** (Partially Achieved) due to the absence of recorded test execution evidence.

**ASPICE CL2 requires all assessed processes to achieve L or F at PA 2.1 and PA 2.2.** The three P-rated processes block CL2 award until issue #152 (test execution evidence) is closed.

### 5.3 Path to CL2

| Priority | Action Required | Issue | Blocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **Must close** | Record SIT-001 to SIT-013 execution results (SWE.5) | #152 | SWE.5 → P to L |
| 🔴 **Must close** | Record SITC-001 to SITC-014 execution results (SYS.4) | #152 | SYS.4 → P to L |
| 🔴 **Must close** | Record SYS-VTC execution evidence with Commit SHA, date, tester (SYS.5) | #152 | SYS.5 → P to L |
| 🟡 **Should close** | SWE2/SYS3 architecture docs updated for package structure | #146 | SWE.2/SYS.3 → L (quality) |
| 🟡 **Should close** | SWE3 source location column updated (all 89 units) | #147 | SWE.3 → L (quality) |
| 🟡 **Should close** | SWE1/SWE3/SWE4 entries for `misc.whitespace_ratio` | #148 | SWE.1/3/4 → L (quality) |
| 🟡 **Should close** | Deferred requirements NF-010/011/012 tracked or decisioned | #153 | SYS.2/5 → L (quality) |
| 🔵 **Nice to close** | Coverage gate aligned with SUP1 90% target | #151 | SUP.1/SWE.4/SWE.6 |
| 🔵 **Nice to close** | MAN3 WBS completion dates | #154 | MAN.3 |
| 🔵 **Nice to close** | Risk mitigations for RISK-003/005 | #155 | MAN.5/ACQ.4 |
| 🔵 **Nice to close** | PA2 version table, SWE4 count, wiki_publish CI item | #150, #156, #157 | Housekeeping |

## 6. Observations

### OBS-001 — Significant Maturity Improvement Since Prior Audit

The prior Analysis Report (2026-04-17) identified 6 critical and 10 warning-level findings. This audit confirms that all 6 critical findings and 8 of the 10 warnings are **resolved**. The project has progressed from a state where fundamental ASPICE infrastructure was missing to a state where all 17 processes are at least Partially achieved and 14 are Largely achieved. This represents a significant maturity improvement in a short timeframe.

### OBS-002 — Test Evidence is the Primary Blocker for CL2

The sole reason CL2 is not awarded is the absence of recorded test execution evidence in SWE5, SYS4, and SYS5. The tests themselves are either well-defined (SIT-001 to SIT-013) or covered by CI. The gap is administrative — results need to be recorded in the document tables. Issue #152 is the single most impactful open action for CL2 achievement.

### OBS-003 — DEV-002 Limits All Processes to L

Because Reviewer = Approver on all work products (accepted via CSC-DEV-002), GP 2.2.3 independence is not fully demonstrated for any process. This prevents any process from being rated F. Processes that would otherwise be F under independent review (SUP.10, SUP.9, ACQ.4) are capped at L. This is a structural constraint of the single-developer project model that cannot be resolved without adding a second team member.

### OBS-004 — Package Refactor Traceability Gap

The package refactor (issue #65, PR #144) was a significant architectural change that was not fully propagated into the ASPICE documentation. Issues #146 (SWE2/SYS3) and #147 (SWE3 source locations) are direct consequences. Future major refactors should include documentation updates as acceptance criteria in the CR before the PR is merged.

### OBS-005 — New Rules Need Documentation Before Implementation Merge

Three rules (comment_ratio, declared_not_defined, whitespace_ratio) were implemented before their ASPICE documentation was updated. While the implementation is correct, the ASPICE traceability chain (SWE1 → SWE3 → SWE4) should be updated as part of the same PR that implements the rule. Issue #148 captures the whitespace_ratio gap; the prior two rules' documentation was added retrospectively.
