## 1. Purpose and Trigger

This audit establishes the formal CL2 capability record for the **v1.5.1 release** of CStyleCheck. The trigger is the promotion of the v1.5.1 tag (`0a5d4bd`) to `main` following a series of ASPICE cross-reference cascade fixes (PRs #324, #326, #332, #334, #335) that updated 11 of the 18 ASPICE work products.

The previous baseline (CSC-AUD-007, v1.4.0, 2026-06-18) rated all 17 processes at F or L. Subsequent development added:

- **Rule 72** (`misc.non_ascii_source`, SWE1-MISRA-004) — closes the non-ASCII source character detection gap
- **SW requirements SWE1-MISRA-001 through SWE1-MISRA-004** — 3 new requirements (SWE1-088 through SWE1-090) plus formal MISRA-aligned IDs for all four
- **SIT-020** — integration test case covering SWE1-MISRA-004, SWE1-089, and SWE1-090
- **1183 unit tests** — 31 additional tests since v1.4.1 (1152→1183)
- **Document revisions** across SWE1–SWE6, SYS2, SYS4, SUP1, SUP8, SVD to reflect the above changes and resolve cross-reference drift found by the internal audit process

## 4. Overall CL2 Verdict

**✅ ASPICE CL2 IS ACHIEVED at v1.5.1.** All 17 processes rate **F** (17 F, 0 L, 0 P/N).

This is an improvement over the v1.4.1 baseline (also 17 F, but with the AUD7-F-001 finding resolved: the 11 v1.3.0/v1.4.0 rules that previously lacked integration/system/qualification test coverage are now fully covered by SIT-020, updated SITC-015, SYS-VTC-003 at 72 rule IDs, and SWQ-003 at 72 rule IDs). The MISRA-rules addition (SWE1-MISRA-004, rule 72) is likewise fully traced from requirements through unit tests and integration.

**No open corrective actions remain from CSC-AUD-007.** The finding AUD7-F-001 (issue #261) is fully resolved.
