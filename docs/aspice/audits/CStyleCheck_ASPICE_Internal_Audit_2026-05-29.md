### 2.2 Artefacts Reviewed

The following artefacts were read and cross-checked during this audit:

- All 21 ASPICE process documents in `docs/aspice/`
- `src/cstylecheck/` package — all 10 source modules
- `src/rules.yml` and `tests/rules.yml`
- All 31 test files under `tests/test_*.py` (including `test_config_loading.py` added in v1.2.1)
- `tests/harness.py`
- `.github/workflows/cstylecheck_tests.yml`
- `.github/workflows/cstylecheck_rules.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docker_publish.yml`
- `.github/workflows/wiki_publish.yml`
- `Dockerfile/Dockerfile` (fixed in v1.2.1)
- `pyproject.toml`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (v1.2.0 and v1.2.1 entries)
- GitHub Issues #161–#169 (open items)
- CI run evidence from GitHub Actions (all green at v1.2.1)

### 2.3 Methodology

For each process the following questions were applied:

**PA 2.1 — Process Performance Management:**
- Are performance objectives defined and measurable? (GP 2.1.1)
- Is there a defined process strategy? (GP 2.1.2)
- Is the process planned, monitored, and adjusted? (GP 2.1.3–5)
- Are responsibilities defined? (GP 2.1.6)
- Are interfaces managed? (GP 2.1.7)

**PA 2.2 — Work Product Management:**
- Are work product requirements defined? (GP 2.2.1)
- Are work products stored and version-controlled? (GP 2.2.2)
- Are work products reviewed before approval? (GP 2.2.3)
- Are work products adjusted based on reviews? (GP 2.2.4)

Evidence gaps were classified using the ASPICE PAM v4.0 scale:

| Rating | Meaning | Achievement Range |
|---|---|---|
| **N** | Not achieved | 0–15% |
| **P** | Partially achieved | 15–50% |
| **L** | Largely achieved | 50–85% |
| **F** | Fully achieved | 85–100% |

| AUD2-F-002 | SYS4 and SYS5 execution tables still contain `<fill at execution>` placeholders — no objective test execution evidence recorded | High | SYS.4, SYS.5 | (open from AUD-001 F-003/F-004/F-007 — issues #152 remain open) |
| AUD2-F-003 | CI coverage gate is 85% combined (statement + branch); SUP1 documented target is 90% statement-only — metric definitions misaligned | Low | SWE.4, SUP.1 | #151 (open) |

### 3.2 AUD-001 Findings — All Resolved

All 15 findings from CSC-AUD-001 were resolved during the v1.2.0 development cycle (issues #143, #146–#157). The table below confirms their closure:

| AUD-001 Finding | Resolution | Evidence at v1.2.1 |
|---|---|---|
| F-001: SWE2/SYS3 described monolith | SYS3 and SWE2 updated to describe 10-module package architecture | CSC-SWE2-001 v1.3, CSC-SYS3-001 v1.3 |

| F-010: yoda_condition/conditions mismatch | SWE1/SWE3/SWE4 corrected to use `yoda_conditions` (plural) | CSC-SWE1-001 v1.4 |
| F-011: MAN3 WBS dates missing | WBS-10 through WBS-16 completion dates added | CSC-MAN3-001 v1.3 |
| F-012: PA2 §5.4 stale | PA2 updated to v1.6 with all work products at v1.2.0 | CSC-PA2-001 v1.6 |
| F-013: SWE4 test count mismatch | SWE4 §5.1 and §6 test counts reconciled | CSC-SWE4-001 v1.4 |
| F-014: RISK-003/005 no mitigation | MAN5 risk entries updated with concrete mitigations and owners | CSC-MAN5-001 v1.2 |
| F-015: SWE3 stale source locations | SWE3 Detailed Design updated with 10-module package structure | CSC-SWE3-001 v1.4 |
| F-017: SWE1/SWE3/SWE4 missing whitespace_ratio | All three documents updated to include `misc.whitespace_ratio` rule | CSC-SWE1/3/4-001 v1.4 |

> **Note:** F-008 (CI path trigger stale) was fixed in PR #145 before AUD-001 was filed and does not appear in AUD-001 findings; it is confirmed resolved.

### 3.3 Newly Observed Positive Evidence

The following items, not present in prior audits, represent improvements observed at v1.2.1:

- **Docker fix issued same day as bug report** (issue #165 raised and closed 2026-05-29): demonstrates active defect management
- **v1.2.1 hotfix published within 24 hours of v1.2.0**: responsive release process
- **839 tests across 31 modules**: substantial regression coverage
- **Subprocess coverage wired**: CLI entry-point branch coverage instrumented via `sitecustomize.py`
- **Codespell gate being added** (issue #161, PR in progress): proactive quality gate expansion
- **`--update-config` flag**: config migration tooling reduces user friction on upgrades
