## 3. Purpose

This document records the generic practices evidence for **Automotive SPICE® PAM v4.0 Capability Level 2** across all assessed processes. It provides a single consolidated reference for assessors to verify PA 2.1 (Process Performance Management) and PA 2.2 (Work Product Management) achievement for CStyleCheck v1.5.1.

**PA 2.1** requires that each process is planned, monitored, and adjusted.
**PA 2.2** requires that work products are defined, stored, controlled, reviewed, and adjusted.

> **Note — AI-Assisted Authorship Deviation (CSC-DEV-001):** The entries below reflect Claude (AI assistant) as the authoring tool used to produce work products. All roles carry **Dermot Murphy** as the accountable human responsible party. The `Author: Claude` fields throughout all 18 ASPICE work products are accepted under deviation record **CSC-DEV-001** (`docs/aspice/CStyleCheck_DEV001_AI_Authorship_Deviation.md`), which documents the justification and residual risk. Claude holds no independent authority; Dermot Murphy reviewed and approved all outputs.

| Role | Authoring Tool | Accountable Person | Process Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project Manager / CM Manager | Claude | Dermot Murphy | MAN.3, MAN.5, SUP.8, ACQ.4 |
| Lead Developer | Claude | Dermot Murphy | SWE.1, SWE.2, SWE.3, SWE.4 implementation |
| Test Lead | Claude | Dermot Murphy | SWE.4, SWE.5, SWE.6, SYS.4, SYS.5 execution |

| Work Product | WP ID (PAM v4.0) | Content Requirements Defined In | CI Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| System Requirements Specification | 17-10 | CSC-SYS2-001 §5 requirements tables | CI-027 (documents) |

| Change Requests | 13-01 | CSC-SUP10-001 §7 register; GitHub Issues | GitHub |
| Supplier Monitoring Records | 08-16 | CSC-ACQ4-001 §5 monitoring tables | CI-027 |

### 5.2 GP 2.2.2 — Store and Control Work Products

| Work Product Type | Storage | Version Control | Access Control |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source code and config files | Git repository (`main` branch + tags) | Git SHA; annotated tags | GitHub repository permissions |
| ASPICE documentation (`.md` files) | Git repository + outputs directory | Git SHA; annotated tags | GitHub repository permissions |
| Docker images | GHCR + Docker Hub | Image tag + SHA-256 digest | GHCR: repository-scoped token |
| Problem reports and CRs | GitHub Issues | Issue number; state; labels | GitHub repository permissions |
| CI run evidence | GitHub Actions logs + artefacts | Workflow run ID; commit SHA | GitHub repository; 30-day artefact retention |
| Release packages | GitHub Releases | Release tag | Public (MIT licence) |

**Baseline procedure:** See CSC-SUP8-001 §8.2.

### 5.3 GP 2.2.3 — Review and Adjust Work Products

> **Note — Single-Person Reviewer Deviation (CSC-DEV-002):** CStyleCheck has one human team member (Dermot Murphy). All ASPICE work products carry `Reviewer: Dermot Murphy` and `Approver: Dermot Murphy` — the same individual. This deviates from the GP 2.2.3 expectation of an independent reviewer. The deviation is formally accepted under **CSC-DEV-002** (`docs/aspice/CStyleCheck_DEV002_Independent_Review_Deviation.md`), which documents the justification, compensating controls (AI-assisted review, CI quality gates, PR audit trail), and residual risk. Assessors may rate this practice as Largely Achieved rather than Fully Achieved on the independence criterion.

All work products are reviewed before approval according to the following schedule:

| Work Product | Review Type | Reviewer | Review Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source code changes | Pull request review | Dermot Murphy (see CSC-DEV-002) | GitHub PR approval record |
| ASPICE documents | Formal document review | Dermot Murphy (see CSC-DEV-002) | Reviewer/Approver table in each document |
| Test suite additions | Pull request review | Dermot Murphy (see CSC-DEV-002) | GitHub PR approval record |
| CI workflow changes | Pull request review | Dermot Murphy (see CSC-DEV-002) | GitHub PR approval record |
| Release baseline | Pre-release checklist | Dermot Murphy / QA role | CSC-SUP1-001 §5.4 signed checklist |

**Adjustment mechanism:** Any non-conformance found during review is raised as a GitHub Issue (SUP.9) or change request (SUP.10) and tracked to resolution before the work product is approved.

> **📋 Rating scale:** N = Not achieved (0–15%), P = Partially achieved (15–50%), L = Largely achieved (50–85%), F = Fully achieved (85–100%). All processes must achieve **L or F** at PA 2.1 and PA 2.2 for CL2 to be awarded.
>
> **✅ CL2 Verdict: ACHIEVED (v1.5.1 baseline).** All 17 processes rate **F** (17 F, 0 L, 0 P/N) at v1.5.1 baseline. Five processes improved from v1.4.1: SYS.4 and SYS.5 (72 rule coverage confirmed; SITC-015/SIT-019 extended + SIT-020 added for SWE1-MISRA-004/089/090); SWE.1 (requirements 88→91); SWE.4 (tests 1152→1183); SWE.5 (SIT 19→20); SWE.6 (SWQ-003 covers 72 rule IDs). Zero processes regressed. Full detail: `docs/aspice/audits/CStyleCheck_ASPICE_Internal_Audit_2026-06-28.md` (CSC-AUD-008).
