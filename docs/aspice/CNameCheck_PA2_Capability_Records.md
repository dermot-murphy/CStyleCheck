## 3. Purpose

This document records the generic practices evidence for **Automotive SPICE® PAM v4.0 Capability Level 2** across all assessed processes. It provides a single consolidated reference for assessors to verify PA 2.1 (Process Performance Management) and PA 2.2 (Work Product Management) achievement for CNameCheck v1.0.0.

**PA 2.1** requires that each process is planned, monitored, and adjusted.
**PA 2.2** requires that work products are defined, stored, controlled, reviewed, and adjusted.
