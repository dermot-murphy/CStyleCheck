# CStyleCheck — ASPICE Peer Review Record v1.2

*Produced using CSC-REVIEW-TEMPLATE-001 v1.0*

> **⚠️ Historical snapshot — pinned to the v1.2.1 baseline, not re-run for later releases.** This record covers the 21 work products as reviewed on 2026-05-29. It is not updated each release; a new review record would need a new document ID/version. For the current document and CL2 status, see `CSC-PA2-001` §5.4/§6 and the latest audit, CSC-AUD-007 (`docs/aspice/audits/CStyleCheck_ASPICE_Internal_Audit_2026-06-18.md`).

## 4. Findings

| Finding ID | Document | Criterion | Severity | Description | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RR-001-001 | CSC-SYS2-001 | C2, C4 | Minor | §3.1 rule count stated as 48; actual count is 53 (three new rules added in v1.2.0: `misc.comment_ratio`, `misc.whitespace_ratio`, `misc.declared_not_defined`). Requires correction. | Open — tracked in issue #163 |
| RR-001-002 | CSC-SYS4-001 | C1 | Minor | §5 execution table contains `<fill at execution>` placeholder entries. Execution evidence should be populated at each release. | Open — tracked in issue #152 |
| RR-001-003 | CSC-SYS5-001 | C1 | Minor | §5 results table contains placeholder entries (tester, date, commit SHA). | Open — tracked in issue #152 |
| RR-001-004 | CSC-SWE4-001 | C5 | Observation | §4 describes coverage target as "90% statement coverage"; the CI gate enforces "85% combined statement + branch". The metric label is slightly inconsistent. | Open — tracked in issue #151 |
| RR-001-005 | CSC-MAN5-001 | C5 | Minor | RISK-003 (solo-developer SPOF) and RISK-005 (AI tool dependency) mitigation descriptions are high-level with no concrete owners or review schedule. | Open — tracked in issue #155 |
| RR-001-006 | CSC-SUP1-001 | C5 | Minor | QA plan references peer reviews but no formal review template is cited. This review record and `CStyleCheck_Review_Template.md` address this gap. | In progress — issue #169 (this PR) |

## 5. Review Summary

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| **Total work products reviewed** | 21 |
| **Work products with no findings** | 15 |
| **Work products with findings** | 6 |
| **Total findings** | 6 |
| **— Major** | 0 |
| **— Minor** | 5 |
| **— Observation** | 1 |
| **Open actions** | 6 (tracked via GitHub issues) |
| **Review verdict** | **Conditional Pass** |

**Verdict rationale:**

All 21 ASPICE work products are substantially complete, consistent, and correctly describe the v1.2.1 codebase. No Major findings were identified. The five Minor findings are all known, tracked items with existing GitHub issues; they do not prevent the v1.2.1 release from meeting CL2 requirements. The Observation on coverage metric wording is cosmetic. The review is approved as Conditional Pass pending resolution of the Minor findings in the v1.3.0 cycle.

## 6. Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reviewer | Claude (AI-assisted) | 2026-05-29 | *Per CSC-DEV-001 (AI authorship deviation)* |
| Author / Review Owner | Dermot Murphy | Merge date of the introducing PR | *Authorised by the owner's merge of the PR that added this record (CSC-DEV-002 §5.2); no signature required* |

> **Note (CSC-DEV-002):** CStyleCheck is developed by a solo engineer. The independent peer-review requirement of ASPICE GP 2.2.3 cannot be satisfied by a separate human reviewer in the conventional sense. This review was conducted by the AI tool (Claude) acting in the reviewer role, as formally documented in CSC-DEV-002. The Review Owner's merge of the PR that added this record constitutes the required management approval; the merge commit is the approval record (approval-by-merge policy of 2026-09-29, CSC-DEV-002 §5.2).
